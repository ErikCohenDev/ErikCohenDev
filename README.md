**About Me**
I'm a web developer who enjoys turning complex problems into simple, easy-to-use solutions.
A US Army veteran and a lifelong learner, I graduated from WGU's Computer Science program and am currently attending Georgia Tech's OMSCS program, specializing in computing systems. When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me in the kitchen trying out new recipes or spending quality time with my daughter.
I'm all about creating web projects that positively impact people's lives and working with folks who share a similar enthusiasm for making things better.
